This is considered to be too low for healthy fertility. A low BMI can result in lower hormone levels and this can interfere with regular ovulation, reducing your likelihood of achieving a pregnancy. A low BMI is also associated with an increased risk of low birth weight babies and premature delivery.

There are over 100 million pages of information available on the Internet, a large portion of which is outdated and potentially dangerous.

When you are finding it difficult to conceive, a thorough review of your obstetric and gynaecological history is essential. There are so many factors that can impact on your fertility that it is important to identify them and design your treatment accordingly. All too often treatment is commenced without taking a thorough history and performing all the appropriate investigations.\r\n\r\nWhile this may seem like the fast track to becoming pregnant, you risk missing the opportunity to identify important elements of your reproductive health that, if addressed, could result in an earlier success. Taking the time to be thoroughly assessed and investigated, rather than launching into a one size fits all treatment plan, is often a better way to become pregnant while avoiding unnecessary disappointment and costs.\r\n\r\nSection 3 reviews and analyses the results of any fertility investigations you have had in relation to your fertility. It provides you with an assessment of your reproductive health and identifies issues that may affect your efforts to conceive. It also provides you with recommendations and explanations of the investigations that you should expect to undergo prior to commencing any fertility treatments. Failure to fully investigate a woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reproductive health prior to commencing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is one of the key reasons for treatment failures. You cannot hope to receive the most effective treatment for your particular physiology and history unless your circumstances are fully investigated and understood.

It describes the investigations, discusses the potential results and specifies how these results may affect you and your efforts to become pregnant.\r\n\r\nSection 4 reviews male reproductive health and outlines the necessary investigations that can be expected in assessing male fertility prior to commencing any fertility treatments. It also provides current fertility treatment options in relation to male infertility.\r\n\r\nSection 5 provides you with information regarding your treatment and treatment options, discusses current trends and describes the various processes involved. Given that you have not commenced any form of ART to date, this section of the report provides you with information about the fertility treatments best suited to your current circumstances and what you should look to avoid. This section describes the process of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), discusses the role that fertility drugs play, how they work and what drug protocols may be best suited to you. This section also reviews the various laboratory techniques that are used in IVF and discusses the processes currently being shown to be associated with higher success rates.\r\n\r\nSection 5 also delves into other areas of ART including the options of donor eggs and donor embryo.\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of section 5 is to provide you with the latest evidence based information in order to prepare and empower you and your partner to be active participants in the decision-making processes necessary to become pregnant.\r\n\r\nSection 5 also includes information on the OnlineMD Fertility Report Editorial Board and detailed illustrations of natural ovarian and stimulated IVF\/ICSI cycles.\r\n\r\nWhere additional information has been provided, you may find on occasion that certain information is repeated.

        "content": "You have indicated that you are not menstruating at all. When you do not menstruate at all, you are probably not ovulating at all and it is extremely unlikely that you will become pregnant spontaneously. When you do not ovulate at all you are said to be anovulatory. There are a number of reasons why you may not be ovulating. Hormonal imbalances are the most common reason for failure to ovulate. Thyroid and pituitary dysfunction can cause hormonal imbalances that effect ovulation. The assessments for thyroid and pituitary dysfunction are outlined in section 3 of this report.\r\n\r\nAnother common hormonal disturbance occurs as a result of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility in women. Polycystic ovaries (PCO) occur when the ovaries repeatedly fail to release the eggs from developing follicles.When this occurs the follicles will fail to develop, shrivel up and the remnants will remain located around the surface of the ovaries. The condition is diagnosed on an ultrasound examination and by definition PCO is present if there are 12 or more follicles within at least one ovary. PCOS is diagnosed if there are PCO ultrasound findings and some clinical symptoms including irregular menstruation or symptoms associated with an excess of male hormones (androgens) produced by the ovary. These include obesity, acne, pimples and increased hair growth.\r\n\r\nDuring fertility treatment, womenwith PCOS tend to be very sensitive to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and will easily over stimulate, making them more susceptible to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). It is important to note that if you have been shown to have polycystic ovaries it does not necessarily mean that you have polycystic ovarian syndrome. You can have polycystic ovaries and not suffer with PCOS. If it is confirmed that you have PCOS and require ovarian stimulation your FSH dose will need to be carefully considered and often reduced to avoid ovarian hyperstimulation. Despite the challenges that PCOS presents, women with PCOS can achieve a safe and successful pregnancy using ART.\r\n\r\nThere is no single test that can diagnose PCOS. However, there are a number of assessments that will assist in confirming whether you have PCOS or not. They include:\r\n\r\nPhysical examination and history. PCOS is often associated with other symptoms including an increased BMI, abnormal hair growth, acne and menstrual irregularities. However, you could have all or none of these symptoms and still suffer with the effects of PCOS.\r\n\r\nA trans-vaginal ultrasoundwill look at the size and shape of your ovaries in order to identify any abnormalities. The appearance of multiple cysts in an ovary is used to make the diagnosis of PCO. It becomes PCOS if symptoms, described above are associated with the ultrasound findings.\r\n\r\nBlood tests that assess the level of a variety of hormones. These tests commonly include:\r\n\r\nEstradiol\r\nProgesterone\r\nFollicle stimulating hormone (FSH)\r\nLuteinizing hormone (LH)\r\nFree testosterone\r\nProlactin\r\nAnti-mullerian hormone (AMH)\r\nDHEA\r\nSex hormone binding globulin\r\n\r\nAn oral glucose tolerance test. This test looks to see if you are insulin resistant. Some women with PCOS are also found to be insulin resistant. This means that the production of insulin needs to be higher to maintain normal blood sugar levels. High levels of insulin can interfere with regular ovulation. Metformin is an oral medication that lowers blood sugar levels countering the affect of high insulin levels and promoting regular ovulation. For some years Metformin was widely used in IVF treatment protocols to restore ovulation, but it has now been shown to be less effective than clomiphene citrate. These days the use of Metformin is restricted to women who are proven to be insulin resistant.\r\n\r\nPremature menopause (also known as premature ovarian insufficiency) may be another reason you are failing to menstruate. Premature menopause occurs when your ovary runs out of responsive follicles, a situation which normally occurs at menopause. Unfortunately there is no treatment for premature menopause and egg or embryo donation using IVF is the best ART option. Elevated FSH levels are used in the diagnosis of premature menopause.",

These include obesity, acne, pimples and increased hair growth.\r\n\r\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\r\n\r\nDuring fertility treatment, womenwith PCOS tend to be very sensitive to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and will easily over stimulate, making them more susceptible to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). It is important to note that if you have been shown to have polycystic ovaries it does not necessarily mean that you have polycystic ovarian syndrome. You can have polycystic ovaries and not suffer with PCOS. If it is confirmed that you have PCOS and require ovarian stimulation your FSH dose will need to be carefully considered and often reduced to avoid ovarian hyperstimulation. Despite the challenges that PCOS presents, women with PCOS can achieve a safe and successful pregnancy using ART.\r\n\r\nThere is no single test that can diagnose PCOS. However, there are a number of assessments that will assist in confirming whether you have PCOS or not. They include:\r\n\r\nPhysical examination and history. PCOS is often associated with other symptoms including an increased BMI, abnormal hair growth, acne and menstrual irregularities. However, you could have all or none of these symptoms and still suffer with the effects of PCOS.\r\n\r\nA trans-vaginal ultrasoundwill look at the size and shape of your ovaries in order to identify any abnormalities. The appearance of multiple cysts in an ovary is used to make the diagnosis of PCO. It becomes PCOS if symptoms, described above are associated with the ultrasound findings.\r\n\r\nBlood tests that assess the level of a variety of hormones. These tests commonly include:\r\n\r\nEstradiol\r\nProgesterone\r\nFollicle stimulating hormone (FSH)\r\nLuteinizing hormone (LH)\r\nFree testosterone\r\nProlactin\r\nAnti-mullerian hormone (AMH)\r\nDHEA\r\nSex hormone binding globulin\r\n\r\nAn oral glucose tolerance test. This test looks to see if you are insulin resistant. Some women with PCOS are also found to be insulin resistant. This means that the production of insulin needs to be higher to maintain normal blood sugar levels. High levels of insulin can interfere with regular ovulation. Metformin is an oral medication that lowers blood sugar levels countering the affect of high insulin levels and promoting regular ovulation. For some years Metformin was widely used in IVF treatment protocols to restore ovulation, but it has now been shown to be less effective than clomiphene citrate. These days the use of Metformin is restricted to women who are proven to be insulin resistant.",

You need to consider losing weight to reduce your BMI. There are a number of treatments and lifestyle changes that can help you reach your goal BMI.\r\nWhen combined with lifestyle changes, selected oral medications may help you to lose weight. It is important that a doctor or fertility specialist oversees the use of any weight loss medications, as some can be harmful during pregnancy. You may be advised to avoid a pregnancy while on weight loss medication in order to avoid any adverse effects the medication may have on a developing baby. Some of these medications may also lower the levels of fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E, which can be important in fertility and the development of a healthy baby. \r\nBecoming pregnant during or immediately after rapid weight loss can expose the baby to the effects of nutritional deficiencies and increase the risk of complications, such as growth retardation and premature delivery.

        "content": "You have indicated that you are not menstruating at all. When you do not menstruate at all you are probably not ovulating at all and it is extremely unlikely that you will become pregnant spontaneously. When you do not ovulate at all you are said to be anovulatory. There are a number of reasons why you may not be ovulating. Hormonal imbalances are the most common reason for failure to ovulate and your diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) may be a contributing factor.\r\nPCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility in women. Polycystic ovaries occur when the ovaries repeatedly fail to release the eggs from developing follicles. When this occurs the follicles will fail to develop, shrivel up and the remnants will remain located around the surface of the ovaries. The condition is diagnosed on an ultrasound examination and by definition PCO is present if there are 12 or more follicles within at least one ovary. PCOS is diagnosed if there are PCO ultrasound findings and some clinical symptoms including irregular menstruation or symptoms associated with an excess of male hormones (androgens) produced by the ovary. These include obesity, acne, pimples and increased hair growth.\r\n\r\nDuring fertility treatment, womenwith PCOS tend to be very sensitive to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and will easily over stimulate, making them more susceptible to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). It is important to note that if you have been shown to have polycystic ovaries it does not necessarily mean you have polycystic ovarian syndrome. You can have polycystic ovaries and not suffer with PCOS. If it is confirmed that you have PCOS and require ovarian stimulation your FSH dose will need to be carefully considered and often reduced to avoid ovarian hyperstimulation. Despite the challenges that PCOS presents, women with PCOS can achieve a safe and successful pregnancy using ART.\r\n\r\nThere is no single test that can diagnose PCOS. However, there are a number of assessments that will assist in confirming whether you have PCOS or not. They include:\r\n\r\nPhysical examination and history. PCOS is often associated with other symptoms including an increased BMI, abnormal hair growth, acne and menstrual irregularities. However, you could have all or none of these symptoms and still suffer with the effects of PCOS.\r\n\r\nA trans-vaginal ultrasound will look at the size and shape of your ovaries in order to identify any abnormalities. The appearance of multiple cysts in an ovary is used to make the diagnosis of PCO. It becomes PCOS if symptoms, described above are associated with the ultrasound findings.\r\n\r\nBlood tests that assess the level of a variety of hormones. These tests commonly include:\r\n\r\nEstradiol\r\nProgesterone\r\nFollicle stimulating hormone (FSH)\r\nLuteinizing hormone (LH)\r\nFree testosterone\r\nProlactin\r\nAnti-mullerian hormone (AMH)\r\nDHEA\r\nSex hormone binding globulin\r\nAn oral glucose tolerance test. This test looks to see if you are insulin resistant. Some women with PCOS are also found to be insulin resistant. This means that the production of insulin needs to be higher to maintain normal blood sugar levels. High levels of insulin can interfere with regular ovulation. Metformin is an oral medication that lowers blood sugar levels countering the affect of high insulin levels and promoting regular ovulation. For some years Metformin was widely used in IVF treatment protocols to restore ovulation, but it has now been shown to be less effective than clomiphene citrate. These days the use of Metformin is restricted to women who are proven to be insulin resistant.\r\nPremature menopause (also known as premature ovarian insufficiency) may be another reason you are failing to menstruate. Premature menopause occurs when your ovary runs out of responsive follicles, a situation which normally occurs at menopause. Elevated FSH levels are used in the diagnosis of premature menopause. Unfortunately there is no treatment for premature menopause and egg or embryo donation using IVF is the best ART option.\r\n\r\nYour low BMI may also be a contributing factor to anovulation. First line treatment for anovulation is to attempt to induce ovulation. Establishing a BMI with normal parameters can help restore ovulation. In the absence of any other identifiable reason for your sub-fertility, treatment may include the use of ovarian stimulating drugs. Fertility treatments specific for anovulation are outlined in Section 5 of this report.",

        "content": "You have indicated that you are not menstruating at all. When you do not menstruate at all you are probably not ovulating at all and it is extremely unlikely that you will become pregnant spontaneously. When you do not ovulate at all you are said to be anovulatory. There are a number of reasons why you may not be ovulating. Hormonal imbalances are the most common reason for failure to ovulate. Thyroid and pituitary dysfunction can cause hormonal imbalances that effect ovulation; the assessments for thyroid and pituitary dysfunction are outlined with section 3 of this report.\r\n\r\nAnother common hormonal disturbance occurs as a result of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility in women. Polycystic ovaries (PCO) occur when the ovaries repeatedly fail to release the eggs from developing follicles.When this occurs the follicles will fail to develop, shrivel up and the remnants will remain located around the surface of the ovaries. The condition is diagnosed on an ultrasound examination and by definition PCO is present if there are 12 or more follicles within at least one ovary. PCOS is diagnosed if there are PCO ultrasound findings and some clinical symptoms including irregular menstruation or symptoms associated with an excess of male hormones (androgens) produced by the ovary. These include obesity, acne, pimples and increased hair growth.\r\n\r\nDuring fertility treatment, womenwith PCOS tend to be very sensitive to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and will easily over stimulate, making them more susceptible to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). It is important to note that if you have been shown to have polycystic ovaries it does not necessarily mean that you have polycystic ovarian syndrome. You can have polycystic ovaries and not suffer with PCOS. If it is confirmed that you have PCOS and require ovarian stimulation your FSH dose will need to be carefully considered and often reduced to avoid ovarian hyperstimulation. Despite the challenges that PCOS presents, women with PCOS can achieve a safe and successful pregnancy using ART.\r\n\r\nThere is no single test that can diagnose PCOS. However, there are a number of assessments that will assist in confirming whether you have PCOS or not. They include:\r\n\r\nPhysical examination and history. PCOS is often associated with other symptoms including an increased BMI, abnormal hair growth, acne and menstrual irregularities. However, you could have all or none of these symptoms and still suffer with the effects of PCOS.\r\n\r\nA trans-vaginal ultrasound will look at the size and shape of your ovaries in order to identify any abnormalities.
